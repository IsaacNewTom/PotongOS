# PotongOS
PotongOS is a 64 bit monolithic operating system, coded for educational purposes and for fun! <br />
I used to work on it just for the fun of it, and now I decided to make it official. <br />
Still in it's VERY early stages though.

# How to run
Run the build script, and boot it up (either using the bochs emulator, or just anything else)
