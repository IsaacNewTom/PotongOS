# PotongOS
PotongOS is a 64 bit monolithic operating system, coded for educational purposes and for fun!    
I used to work on it just for the fun of it, and now I decided to make it official.   
Still in it's VERY early stages though.  

# How to run
Run the build script, and boot it up (I personally prefer using bochs, hence the bxrc file, since booting a whole machine takes a pretty long time)
